At a party near the Bennets’ home in the English countryside, Elizabeth meets the wealthy, proud Fitzwilliam Darcy. Elizabeth initially finds Darcy haughty and intolerable, but circumstances continue to unite the pair. Mr. Darcy finds himself captivated by Elizabeth’s wit and candor, while her reservations about his character slowly vanish. The story is as much a social critique as it is a love story, and the prose crackles with Austen’s wry wit.",

A sheer delight for Jane Austen fans, The Annotated Pride and Prejudice contains the complete text of Pride and Prejudice with thousands of annotations, including: • Explanations of historical context: Rules of etiquette, class differences, the position of women, legal and economic realities, leisure activities, and more. • Citations from Austen’s life, letters, and other writings: Parallels between the novel and Austen’s experience are revealed, along with writings that illuminate her beliefs and opinions. • Definitions and clarifications: Archaic words, words still in use whose meanings have changed, and obscure passages are explained. • Literary comments and analyses: Insightful notes highlight Austen’s artistry and point out the subtle ways she develops her characters and themes. • Maps and illustrations: See the places and objects mentioned in the novel. • An introduction, a bibliography, and a detailed chronology of events Of course, one can enjoy the novel without knowing the precise definition of a gentleman, or what it signifies that a character drives a coach rather than a hack chaise, or the rules governing social interaction at a ball, but readers of The Annotated Pride and Prejudice will find that these kinds of details add immeasurably to understanding and enjoying the intricate psychological interplay of Austen’s immortal characters.",

Belum sebulan mengenalmu, aku sudah tahu bahwa kau adalah pria yang takkan mungkin kunikahi.\" Di mata Elizabeth, Mr. Darcy tidak pernah menjadi sosok yang memesona. Baginya, laki-laki itu angkuh, sombong, dan menyebalkan. Elizabeth membenci tatapannya yang merendahkan, cara bicaranya yang meremehkan, dan segala hal tentang bangsawan kaya raya itu. Kebencian itu semakin bertambah ketika Elizabeth tahu bahwa Mr. Darcy telah melakukan hal yang menurutnya tak bisa dimaafkan.ÿ Butuh lama bagi Elizabeth untuk memahami sisi lain dari Mr. Darcy dan menerima kenyataan akan kebaikannya yang tersembunyi. Dan, ketika akhirnya gadis itu menyadari perasaannya kepada Mr. Darcy telah berkembang menjadi cinta, dia pun jadi ragu, akankah dia bisa menebus prasangkanya yang sangat buruk pada laki-laki itu? Lalu, akankah cintanya yang baru tumbuh itu menjadi sia-sia? Dalam Pride and Prejudice, Jane Austen menuangkan detail yang memikat mengenai kaum menengah ke atas pada abad ke-19. Karakter-karakternya yang memukau, juga narasinya yang cerdas, menjadikan novel ini sebagai salah satu roman terpopuler sepanjang masa. [Mizan, Qanita, Novel, Memoar, Indonesia]",

        "description": "A Story of lively and rebellious Elizabeth Bennett, one of five unmarried daughters living in the countryside of 19th century England. In a world where obtaining an advantageous marriage is a woman's sole occupation, Elizabeth's independent manner threatens her families future. Will her romantic sparing with the mysterious, sophisticated and arrogant E'Arcy end in misfortune-- or will love's true nature prevail? -- Jane Austen's superb romantic classic comedy follows a cast of society's elite through the games of love and negotiations of marriage in the countryside of 19th century England. It is a lighthearted commentary on the aristocratic and near-aristrocratic English country life. By the use of gentile irony, it shows us our own vanities and prejudices and encourages us to see in every person, an individual to be judged strictly on his or her own merits.",

        "description": "Pride and prejudice : a novel, By Jane Austencomplete in ine volume Pride and Prejudice is a novel of manners by Jane Austen, first published in 1813. The story follows the main character, Elizabeth Bennet, as she deals with issues of manners, upbringing, morality, education, and marriage in the society of the landed gentry of the British Regency. Elizabeth is the second of five daughters of a country gentleman, Mr. Bennet, living in Longbourn.Page 2 of a letter from Jane Austen to her sister Cassandra (11 June 1799) in which she first mentions Pride and Prejudice, using its working title First Impressions. (NLA)Set in England in the late 18th century, Pride and Prejudice tells the story of Mr. and Mrs. Bennet''s five unmarried daughters after two gentlemen have moved into their neighbourhood: the rich and eligible Mr. Bingley, and his status-conscious friend, the even more rich and eligible Mr. Darcy. While Bingley takes an immediate liking to the eldest Bennet daughter, Jane, Darcy is disdainful of local society and repeatedly clashes with the Bennets'' lively second daughter, Elizabeth.Pride and Prejudice retains a fascination for modern readers, continuing near the top of lists of \"most loved books\". It has become one of the most popular novels in English literature, selling over 20 million copies, and receives considerable attention from literary scholars. Likewise, it has paved the way for archetypes that abound in many contemporary literature of our time. Modern interest in the book has resulted in a number of dramatic adaptations and an abundance of novels and stories imitating Austen''s memorable characters or themes.The novel centres on Elizabeth Bennet, the second of the five daughters of a landed country gentleman. Elizabeth''s father, Mr. Bennet, is a bookish man and somewhat neglectful of his responsibilities. In contrast Elizabeth''s mother, Mrs. Bennet, a woman who lacks social graces, is primarily concerned with finding suitable husbands for her five daughters, who will inherit little or nothing from their father due to primogeniture laws. Jane Bennet, the eldest daughter, is distinguished by her kindness and beauty; Elizabeth Bennet shares her father''s keen wit and occasionally sarcastic outlook; Mary is studious, devout and musical albeit lacking in taste; Catherine, sometimes called Kitty, the fourth sister, follows where her younger sister leads while Lydia is flirtatious and lacks maturity.The narrative opens with news in the Bennet family that Mr. Bingley, a wealthy, charismatic and sociable young bachelor, is moving into Netherfield Park in the neighbourhood. Mr. Bingley is soon well received while his friend Mr. Darcy makes a less favourable impression by appearing proud and condescending at a ball that they attend (he detests dancing and is not one for light conversation). Mr. Bingley singles out Jane for particular attention, and it soon becomes apparent that they have formed an attachment to each other. While Jane does not alter her conduct for him, she confesses her great happiness only to Lizzie. By contrast, Darcy slights Elizabeth, who overhears and jokes about it despite feeling a budding resentment.Upon paying a visit to Mr.Bingley''s sister, Caroline, Jane is caught in a heavy downpour, catching cold, and is forced to stay at Netherfield for several days. Elizabeth arrives to nurse her sister and is thrown into frequent company with Mr.Darcy, who begins to act less coldly towards her.Mr.Collins,a clergyman and heir to Longbourn, the Bennet estate, pays a visit to the Bennets.Mr.Bennet and Elizabeth are much amused by his obsequious veneration of his employer,the noble Lady Catherine de Bourgh, as well as by his self-important and pedantic nature.It soon becomes apparent that Mr. Collins proposes marriage to Elizabeth,who refuses him, much to her mother''s distress. Mr. Collins recovers and promptly becomes engaged to Elizabeth''s close friend Charlotte Lucas, a homely woman with few prospects.",

        "description": "A perennial favorite in the Norton Critical Editions series, Pride and Prejudice is based on the 1813 first edition text, which has been thoroughly annotated for undergraduate readers. \"Backgrounds and Sources\" includes biographical portraits of Austen by members of her family and by acclaimed biographers Claire Tomalin and David Nokes. Seventeen of Austen's letters—eight of them new to the Third Edition—allow readers to glimpse the close-knit society that was Austen's world, both in life and in her writing. Samples of Austen's early writing—from the epistolary Love and FriendshipA Collection of Letters—allow readers to trace her growth as a writer as well as to read her fiction comparatively. \"Criticism\" features eighteen assessments of the novel by nineteenth- and twentieth-century commentators, six of them new to the Third Edition. Among them is an interview with Colin Firth on the recent BBC television adaptation of the novel. Also included are pieces by Richard Whately, Margaret Oliphant, Richard Simpson, D. W. Harding, Dorothy Van Ghent, Alistair Duckworth, Stuart Tave, Marilyn Butler, Nina Auerbach, Susan Morgan, Claudia L. Johnson, Susan Fraiman, Deborah Kaplan, Tara Goshal Wallace, Cheryl L. Nixon, David Spring, Edward Ahearn, and Donald Gray. Also included are a Note on Money, a Chronology of Austen's life and work—new to the Third Edition—and an updated Selected Bibliography. About the Series: No other series of classic texts equals the caliber of the Norton Critical Editions. Each volume combines the most authoritative text available with the comprehenive pedagogical apparatus necessary to appreciate the work fully. Careful editing, first-rate translation, and thorough explanatory annotations allow each text to meet the highest literary standards while remaining accessible to students. Each edition is printed on acid-free paper and every text in the series remains in print. Norton Critical Editions are the choice for excellence in scholarship for students at more than 2,000 universities worldwide.",
