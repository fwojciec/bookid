        "description": "F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" is a masterful exploration of the American Dream during the Roaring Twenties, a period marked by excess and disillusionment. Through the eyes of the enigmatic narrator, Nick Carraway, Fitzgerald employs lush, lyrical prose and vivid imagery to illuminate the opulence and moral decay of 1920s America. The intricate interplay of wealth, love, and social status is encapsulated in the tragic tale of Jay Gatsby, whose obsessive pursuit of the elusive Daisy Buchanan becomes a poignant critique of the era's materialism. This novel's rich symbolism and innovative narrative structure situate it as a pivotal work in American literature, encapsulating both the hopeful dreams and sobering realities of its time. Fitzgerald himself was a keen observer of the American upper class, drawing on his experiences in the East Coast elite circles and his tumultuous marriage to Zelda Sayre. The discontent and yearning for identity mirrored in Gatsby'Äôs journey reflect Fitzgerald'Äôs own struggles with success, love, and the societal expectations of his time. The author'Äôs exposure to wealth and its ephemeral nature deeply informs the narrative, shedding light on the contradictions of his characters'Äô lives. \"The Great Gatsby\" is essential reading for anyone seeking to understand the complexities of early 20th-century America and the paradoxes of the American Dream. With its timeless themes and expertly crafted prose, this novel resonates with contemporary discussions of identity, aspiration, and the hollowness of wealth. Readers are invited to journey into Gatsby's world'Äîa testament to hope, tragedy, and the often unattainable nature of dreams.",

It doesn't matter how many times it's adapted into film. Or theater. Or opera. It's through F. Scott Fitzgerald's masterful prose that the story of the ruthless and extravagant Jay Gatsby, narrated by the honest Nick Carraway, continues to live on as the great American classic. F. SCOTT FITZGERALD [1896-1940] was an American author, born in St. Paul, Minnesota. His legendary marriage to Zelda Montgomery, along with their acquaintances with notable figures such as Gertrude Stein and Ernest Hemingway, and their lifestyle in 1920s Paris, has become iconic. A master of the short story genre, it is logical that his most famous novel is also his shortest: The Great Gatsby [1925].",

        "description": "A collectible hardcover edition of one of the great American novels—and one of America's most popular—featuring an introduction by Min Jin Lee, the New York Times bestselling author of Pachinko A Penguin Vitae Edition Young, handsome, and fabulously rich, Jay Gatsby seems to have everything. But at his mansion east of New York City, in West Egg, Long Island, where the party seems never to end, he's often alone in the glittering Jazz Age crowd, watching and waiting, as speculation swirls around him—that he's a bootlegger, that he was a German spy during the war, that he even killed a man. As writer Nick Carraway is drawn into this decadent orbit, he begins to see beneath the shimmering surface of the enigmatic Gatsby, for whom one thing will always be out of reach: Nick's cousin, the married Daisy Buchanan, whose house is visible from Gatsby's just across the bay. A brilliant evocation of the Roaring Twenties and a satire of a postwar America obsessed with wealth and status, The Great Gatsby is a novel whose power remains undiminished after a century. This edition, based on scholarship dating back to the novel's first publication in 1925, restores Fitzgerald's masterpiece to the original American classic he envisioned, and features an introduction addressing how gender, race, class, and sexuality complicate the pursuit of the American Dream. Penguin Vitae—loosely translated as \"Penguin of one's life\"—is a deluxe hardcover series from Penguin Classics celebrating a dynamic and diverse landscape of classic fiction and nonfiction from seventy-five years of classics publishing. Penguin Vitae provides readers with beautifully designed classics that have shaped the course of their lives, and welcomes new readers to discover these literary gifts of personal inspiration, intellectual engagement, and creative originality.",

        "description": "F. Scott Fitzgerald's \"The Great Gatsby\" stands as a quintessential exploration of the American Dream and the moral decay underlying the opulence of the Roaring Twenties. Through the eyes of the enigmatic narrator Nick Carraway, Fitzgerald weaves a rich narrative infused with vivid imagery and lyrical prose, depicting a world of lavish parties, unrequited love, and tragic disillusionment. The novel's iconic characters, particularly the elusive Jay Gatsby, embody the contradictions of an era defined by excess and longing, inviting readers to critically examine the nature of aspiration and identity in a rapidly changing society. Fitzgerald, an emblematic figure of the Jazz Age, drew upon his own experiences of wealth, ambition, and societal expectations to craft this poignant tale. His observations of both the glamour and the hollowness of high society were informed by his tumultuous relationship with Zelda Sayre, which mirrored the novel's themes of idealism and romantic disillusionment. Writing during a time of great social change, Fitzgerald'Äôs work reflects the complexities of his own life and the broader American experience in the 1920s. \"The Great Gatsby\" is a must-read for anyone seeking a deeper understanding of American literature and its critique of social values. Fitzgerald's timeless narrative illuminates the fragility of dreams and the elusive nature of happiness, making it an essential text for readers who wish to grasp the complexities of human desire and the American experience.",

        "description": "A sumptuously illustrated adaptation casts the powerful imagery of F. Scott Fitzgerald’s great American novel in a vivid new format. From the green light across the bay to the billboard with spectacled eyes, F. Scott Fitzgerald’s 1925 American masterpiece roars to life in K. Woodman-Maynard’s exquisite graphic novel—among the first adaptations of the book in this genre. Painted in lush watercolors, the inventive interpretation emphasizes both the extravagance and mystery of the characters, as well as the fluidity of Nick Carraway’s unreliable narration. Excerpts from the original text wend through the illustrations, and imagery and metaphors are taken to literal, and often whimsical, extremes, such as when a beautiful partygoer blooms into an orchid and Daisy Buchanan pushes Gatsby across the sky on a cloud. This faithful yet modern adaptation will appeal to fans with deep knowledge of the classic, while the graphic novel format makes it an ideal teaching tool to engage students. With its timeless critique of class, power, and obsession, The Great Gatsby Graphic Novel captures the energy of an era and the enduring resonance of one of the world’s most beloved books.",

        "description": "Library of America’s authoritative Fitzgerald edition continues with his greatest masterpiece and best story collection of stories in newly edited texts This long-awaited second volume of Library of America’s authoritative edition of F. Scott Fitzgerald features the author’s acknowledged masterpiece and most popular book, The Great Gatsby. It was Gatsby that solidified his reputation as the chronicler of the Jazz Age and established him as one of the leading American novelists of his generation. Perhaps no other novel of the twentieth century makes a greater claim to being our Great American Novel—for its poetic prose, its exploration of the broad, intertwined themes of money, class, and American optimism (Daisy Buchanan’s voice is “full of money”), its dominance of high school and college curricula, and its claims upon the public imagination. The novel is presented in a newly edited text, correcting numerous errors and restoring Fitzgerald’s preferred American spellings. Also included in this volume are Fitzgerald’s third collection of stories, All the Sad Young Men, which includes some of the author’s best short fiction—\"Winter Dreams,” “The Rich Boy,” and “Absolution”—as well as a generous selection of stories and nonfiction from the period 1920–1926, all in newly corrected texts.",

        "description": "The \"Fresh Air\" book critic investigates the enduring power of The Great Gatsby -- \"The Great American Novel we all think we've read, but really haven't.\" Conceived nearly a century ago by a man who died believing himself a failure, it's now a revered classic and a rite of passage in the reading lives of millions. But how well do we really know The Great Gatsby? As Maureen Corrigan, Gatsby lover extraordinaire, points out, while Fitzgerald's masterpiece may be one of the most popular novels in America, many of us first read it when we were too young to fully comprehend its power. Offering a fresh perspective on what makes Gatsby great -- and utterly unusual -- So We Read On takes us into archives, high school classrooms, and even out onto the Long Island Sound to explore the novel's hidden depths, a journey whose revelations include Gatsby 's surprising debt to hard-boiled crime fiction, its rocky path to recognition as a \"classic,\" and its profound commentaries on the national themes of race, class, and gender. With rigor, wit, and infectious enthusiasm, Corrigan inspires us to re-experience the greatness of Gatsby and cuts to the heart of why we are, as a culture, \"borne back ceaselessly\" into its thrall. Along the way, she spins a new and fascinating story of her own.",
